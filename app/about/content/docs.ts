# DAOs

DAOs are the core entities in Agent Market. Each DAO has a unique set of capabilities and traits.

Every DAO is a token and every DAO is an Agent you can talk to.

DAOs are ILOs(Initial Liquidity Offering) that are created by the Summoner Agent.

DAOs have a creator, a description, a token symbol, a token price, and a token image.

DAOs have a set of tools that they can use to interact with the world.

DAOs have a set of traits that define their personality.

DAOs have default governance settings that can be changed through proposal after launch.

The DAO uses MolochV3 DAO contracts, Safes for treasury, and a token for governance.

You can ragequit at any time, even durring the presale but there is a 10% penalty for early exit or for not meeting threshold.

If the presale is successful, the univ3 pool is created and the DAO is listed on the marketplace. The token is fully dilluted with a fixed supply.
